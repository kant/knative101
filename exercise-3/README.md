## Deploy Our first Knative application

Let's get our first Knative application up & running. Using the Build & Serving components of Knative, we can go from some source code on github to a docker image built on cluster (using the Kaniko build template), to a docker image pushed to dockerhub, and ultimately a URL to access our application.


### Update domain configuration for Knative
When a Knative application is deployed, Knative will define a URL for your application. By default, this url is "default.example.com." Because we want our application to be accessible at a URL we own, we need to configure Knative to assign new applications to our own hostname.

What hostname should we use? Luckily for us, IBM Kubernetes Service gave us an external domain when we created our cluster. We'll first get that URL, tell Knative to assign new applications to that URL, and then forward requests to our Ingress Subdomain to the Knative Istio Gateway.

1. First, let's get the ingress subdomain for our cluster.

	```
	ibmcloud ks cluster-get <my-cluster-name>
	```

	Example Output:
	```
	Ingress Subdomain:      bmv-knative.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud   
	```
	Ingress is a Kubernetes service that balances network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to your apps. This Ingress Subdomain is an externally available and public URL providing access to your cluster. Take note of this Ingress Subdomain.

2. Next, update the default URL for new Knative apps by editing the configuration:

	```
	kubectl edit cm config-domain --namespace knative-serving
	```

3. Change instances of `default.example.com` to your ingress subdomain, which should look like: `bmv-knative.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud`. New Knative applications will now be assigned a route with this host, rather than `default.example.com`.

### Forward specific requests coming into IKS ingress to the Knative Ingress Gateway

1. When requests come in to our fibonacci application through the ingress subdomain, we want them to be forwarded to the Knative ingress gateway. Update the `forward-ingress.yaml` file with your own ingress subdomain, prepended with `fib-knative.default`, or whatever subdomain you would like your application to live at. The file should look something like:

	```yaml
  	apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
  	kind: Ingress
	metadata:
	name: iks-knative-ingress
	namespace: istio-system
	spec:
	rules:
        - host: fib-knative.default.bmv-knative.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud
	http:
	paths:
	- path: /
	backend:
	serviceName: knative-ingressgateway
	servicePort: 80
	```

2. Apply the ingress rule.

	```
	kubectl apply --filename forward-ingress.yaml
	```

### Deploy the Fibonacci App Using kubectl and service.yaml

1. Edit the `service.yaml` file to point to your own container registry.

2. Apply the `service.yaml` file to your cluster.

	```
	kubectl apply -f service.yaml
	```
3. Run `kubectl get pods --watch` to see the pods initializing.

4. Once all the pods are initialized, go to dockerhub to see that your container image was built and pushed to dockerhub.

5. Now that the app is up, we should be able to call it using a number input. We can do that using a curl command against the URL provided to us:

	```
	curl -X POST http://fib-knative.default.<your-ingress-subdomain>/fib -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"number":20}'
	```
6. You should see the first 20 Fibonacci numbers!

7. If we left this application alone for some time, it would scale itself back down to 0, and terminate the pods that were created. The default for Knative scale-to-zero is 5 minutes. Let's decrease this time by editing the autoscaler:

	```
	kubectl edit cm config-autoscaler --namespace knative-serving
	```

7. Find `scale-to-zero-threshold`, and decrease the time from 5m to 1m. You can also decrease the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` to 30s.

8. Run `kubectl get pods --watch` and wait to see the application scale itself back down to 0 in the next 1.5 minutes.
